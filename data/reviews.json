After 4 years in the corporate world, my CV needed a refresh in terms of presentation, format and content. Mr. Passi took on the task of revamping my CV, starting with a full understanding of my professional background and future aspirations. Apart from best practices with regards to format, he worked with me on content, highlighting my strengths and building a concise and informative resume. I received admission into my school of choice and have since worked on the revised resume as a starting point for all job applications as well."
